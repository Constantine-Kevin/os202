<br>
## Top 10 List Week 06:<br>
**1.[Concurrency](https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/process/workflow/ana_desi/co_cncry.htm)**<br>
In short, Concurrency means doing/executing multiple program instruction at the same time. More information regarding difficulties in the link.<br>
**2.[Fork System Call](https://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/NOTES/process/fork/create.html)**<br>
Fork is a syscall which is used to create a new process called a child process which will be discussed next. Both parent and child will be executed simultaniously.<br>
The Process will return either: <br>Positive Value(Process ID of child process)<br>0 (Return child process)<br>Negative Value(Fork Failed)<br>
**3.[Child Process](https://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/NOTES/process/fork/create.html)**<br>
Child Process is a duplicate process of the caller with the same program counter, cpu register, and instruction to execute. **Variable** change is kind of "local" to a process, for example in the child, i is modified from 1 to 2, for parent's instruction execution the i value is still the same(1) while only the child is impacted. <br>
**4.[Process ID(PID)](https://delightlylinux.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/what-is-pid-and-ppid/)**<br>
Process ID or in short PID is a unique number which identifies a process to the system. The most common use for it is the process killing purposes.<br>
**5.[Fork in Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/985281/what-is-the-closest-thing-windows-has-to-fork)**<br>
What i found out is that fork() doesn't compile within Windows Environment as it is only present in LINUX or UNIX Library. [Here](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-use-fork-function-in-c-on-window-or-can-I-create-one) is an answer by John Stephenson if you want an "equivalent" on Windows<br>
**6.[Parent Process ID (PPID)](https://delightlylinux.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/what-is-pid-and-ppid/)**<br>
Parent Process ID is quite simple actually, the PID of the parent's process from a child process's perspective.Why is it important? The most effective way to kill a "zombie"process(Process that is dead but still running which takes up memory/resource)is to track the parent process and kill it.<br>
**7.[What Does PPID 1 Means?](https://www.pks.mpg.de/~mueller/docs/suse10.2/html/opensuse-manual_en/manual/sec.boot.init.html)**<br>
Some users describe it in a nutshell [here](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/why-is-the-ppid-is-1-for-a-user-process-717077/).But if you need a more comprehensive
idea as to why, if the parent is "dead"/finished before the child then the child will have a PPID of 1 which is the init/father of all process.<br>
**8.[Wait System Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wait-system-call-c/)**<br>
Wait is as it name implies, wait the upcoming instruction within the parent's process until the child process is terminated/finished.The return value could vary, if only 1 child exist, then it will return the child PID.If there is more than 1 child, look into the link above for more info.<br>
**9.[fflush](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-fflushstdin-c/)**<br>
Flush is as it names implies, flushes the output buffer and move it to the console or disk.<br>
**10.[How to terminate a process](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-kill-a-process-in-linux)**<br>
As it is pointed out above, PID is important to kill a process, the link above shows how to kill a process. It is much easier to kill a process with PID as it doesn't cause ambiguity with similar process name as PID is **unique**.
