## Top 10 List Week 03:<br>
**1.[.asc File](https://fileinfo.com/extension/asc)**<br>
An ASC file is an armored ASCII file used by Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), an encryption program utilized for secure communication.The ASC file is commonly used for posting online security notices as well as securely transmitting messages via email and text.<br>
**2.[tar File](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)**<br>
Short for Tape Archive, a file that has the TAR file extension is a file in the Consolidated Unix Archive format. A program or command that can open archives is needed to open a TAR file.  <br>
**3.[File Permission](https://www.guru99.com/file-permissions.html)**<br>
**Read**: This permission give you the authority to open and read a file. Read permission on a directory gives you the ability to lists its content.<br>
**Write**: The write permission gives you the authority to modify the contents of a file. <br>
**Execute**:  In Linux, The permission to run a file.<br>
**4.[File System](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5510/file-system)**<br>
A file system is a process that manages how and where data on a storage disk, typically a hard disk drive (HDD), is stored, accessed and managed. <br>
**5.[Partition](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-partition-2625958)**<br>
A partition can be thought of as a division or "part" of a real hard disk drive.A partition is really only a logical separation from the whole drive, but it appears as though the division creates multiple physical drives. <br>
**6.[File Extension](https://techterms.com/definition/fileextension)**<br>
A file extension (or simply "extension") is the suffix at the end of a filename that indicates what type of file it is.While most file extensions are three characters in length, they can be as short as one character or longer than twenty characters.<br>
**7.[Directory](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/director.htm)**<br>
A directory is a location for storing files on your computer. Directories are found in a hierarchical file system, such as Linux, MS-DOS, OS/2, and Unix.<br>
**8.[Disk Defragmentation](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14331/disk-defragmentation)**<br>
Defragmentation is the process of consolidating fragmented files on the user's hard drive.
The process of defragmentation moves the data blocks on the hard drive around to bring all the parts of a file together. Files become fragmented when data is written to disk, and there is not enough contiguous space to hold the complete file.Defragmentation reduces file system fragmentation, increasing the efficiency of data retrieval and thereby improving the overall performance of the computer.<br>
**9.[Virtual File System](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html)**<br>
The Virtual File System (also known as the Virtual Filesystem Switch) is the software layer in the kernel that provides the filesystem interface to userspace programs. It also provides an abstraction within the kernel which allows different filesystem implementations to coexist.<br>
**10.[ASCII Armor](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23150/ascii-armor)**<br>
ASCII armor is a binary-to-textual encoding converter. ASCII armor is a feature of a type of encryption called pretty good privacy (PGP). ASCII armor involves encasing encrypted messaging in ASCII so that they can be sent in a standard messaging format such as email.
