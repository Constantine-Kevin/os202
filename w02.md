## Top 10 List Week 02:<br>
**1.[Access Control List](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/access-control-list)**<br>
An access control list (ACL) is a table that tells a computer operating system which access rights each user has to a particular system object, such as a file directory or individual file. <br>
**2.[C Language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/benefits-c-language-programming-languages/)**<br>
C is a middle-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie during the early 1970s while working at AT&T Bell Labs in the USA. The objective of its development was in the context of the re-design of the UNIX operating system to enable it to be used on multiple computers.C is highly portable and is used for scripting system applications which form a major part of Windows, UNIX, and Linux operating system. <br>
**3.[Cryptography](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption-what-are-differences)**<br>
Cryptography is a method of using advanced mathematical principles in storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those whom it is intended can read and process it.<br>
**4.[Symmetric Encryption](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption-what-are-differences)**<br>
This is the simplest kind of encryption that involves only one secret key to cipher and decipher information. Symmetrical encryption is an old and best-known technique. It uses a secret key that can either be a number, a word or a string of random letters.<br>
**5.[Asymmetric Encryption](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption-what-are-differences)**<br>
Asymmetrical encryption is also known as public key cryptography, which is a relatively new method, compared to symmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys to encrypt a plain text. Secret keys are exchanged over the Internet or a large network.<br>
**6.[Access Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-matrix-in-operating-system/)**<br>
Access Matrix is a security model of protection state in computer system. It is represented as a matrix. Access matrix is used to define the rights of each process executing in the domain with respect to each object. The rows of matrix represent domains and columns represent objects. Each cell of matrix represents set of access rights which are given to the processes of domain means each entry(i, j) defines the set of operations that a process executing in domain Di can invoke on object Oj.<br>
**7.[One Time Password](https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/otp.html)[& Two-Factor Authentication](https://safecomputing.umich.edu/two-factor-authentication)**<br>
 One Time Password: One-time passwords are passwords that are used once and then thrown away. A mechanism is provided one way or another to supply the user with an endless supply of these passwords in a secure way.<br>
Two-Factor Authentication:Two-factor means that when you log in, you provide two proofs of your identity.<br>
