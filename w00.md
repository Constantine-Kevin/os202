## Top 10 List Week 00:<br>
**1. von Neumann model <br>**
The von Neumann architecture—also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture—is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann and consist of: CPU, control unit, memory, storage unit, and I/O<br>
**2. APIC <br>**
In computing, Intel's Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) is a family of interrupt controllers; which is an integrated circuit that helps a microprocessor (or CPU) handle interrupt requests (IRQ) coming from multiple different sources (like external I/O devices) which may occur simultaneously.<br>
**3. Interrupt Handling<br>**
Interrupt handling is a key function in real-time software, and comprises interrupts and their handlers. Only those physical interrupts which of high enough priority can be centered into system interrupt table.<br>
**4.Scripting<br>**
A scripting or script language is a programming language for a special run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted, rather than compiled.<br>
**5.I/O<br>**
Input/output or I/O is the communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.<br>
**6.I/O Manager<br>**
The I/O manager is the heart of the I/O system. It connects applications and system components to virtual, logical, and physical devices, and it defines the infrastructure that supports device drivers.<br>
**7.Memory Manager<br>**
Memory manager is a utility software that helps manage memory more efficiently and provides additional features such as flushing out unused segments of memory. All modern operating systems provide memory management.<br>
**8.Virtual Memory<br>**
Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine" which "creates the illusion to users of a very large memory"<br>
**9.UEFI<br>**
The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware.<br>
**10.GRUB<br>**
GNU GRUB (or just GRUB) is a boot loader package that supports multiple operating systems on a computer. During boot-up, the user can select the operating system to run.A bootloader is very important as it is impossible to start an operating system without it. It is the first program which starts when the program is switched on. The bootloader transfers the control to the operating system kernel.
