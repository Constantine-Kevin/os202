Starting from this week, i would try to summarize things in a nutshell. Feedbacks are highly appreciated!
<br>

## Top 10 List Week 05:<br>
**1.[Virtual Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)**<br>
Virtual Memory or VRAM is storage used as if it's the main memory. More info within the link.<br>
**2.[Advantage of Virtual Memory](https://www.guru99.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system.html)**<br>
Allow faster speed when only a particular segment of the program is required for the execution, and allows multiprogramming. <br>
**3.[Disadvantage of Virtual Memory](https://www.guru99.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system.html)**<br>
Mostly the downside is less stability, storage, and performance compared to using actual main memory/RAM.<br>
**4.[How does Virtual Memory Work]https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/virtual-memory.html()**<br>
This is quite tedious, but in short there are two terms to know: Virtual Memory Manager(VMM) and swapping.The address is stored in the Virtual Memory while the actual data in the main memory,
so if a segment is used, it will swap between each other and the one who manage it is the VMM.<br>
**5.[Thrashing](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/virtual-memory.html)**<br>
In short, if the main memory is less than the virtual memory-> many swaps-> slow down the system.<br>
**6.[Prevent Thrashing](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/virtual-memory.html)**<br>
There are many ways to prevent thrashing with optimazation, but to put it simply, the easiest way is to increase the main memory or reduce application running simultaneously.<br>
**7.[First-In-First-Out](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fifo-vs-lifo-approach-in-programming/)**<br>
If you've taken the data structure courses, this is the concept of Queue, whatever goes first exits first and vice versa.<br>
**8.[Memory Paging](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/paging-and-segmentation.html)**<br>
In short, paging is like giving an address to a block of memory.More info with relation with Virtual Memory within the link.<br>
**9.[Page Fault](https://techterms.com/definition/page_fault)**<br>
In short, page fault means that the data is not within the main memory/RAM when being accesed.<br>
**10.[Belady's anomaly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beladys-anomaly-in-page-replacement-algorithms/)**<br>
A phenomena where increasing the number of page frames results in more page fault.<br>
