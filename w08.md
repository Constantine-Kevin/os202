TLDR One page For all:
[Here](https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/6_CPU_Scheduling.html) is The all in one page solution for this week's topic.<br>
Another simple picture for Two state model:

## Top 10 List Week 08:<br>
**1.[CPU Burst](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/scheduling/scheduling.html)**<br>
The amount of time the process uses the processor before it is no longer ready <br>
**2.[I/O Burst](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-CPU-Burst-and-I-O-Burst)**<br>
Followup to a CPU Burst.This is a good description by Phillip Remaker for no 1 and 2:I/O burst read or writes data until the requested data is read/written or the space to store it cache runs out. <br>
**3.[CPU Scheduler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)**<br>
Also known as **short term scheduler** or **dispatcher**,is a special program which work like a followup to scheduler. The scheduler is the one who manage the order but the dispatcher is like the one who execute it. <br>
**4.[Medium Term Scheduler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)**<br>
A part of swapping; a process to remove the suspended process from memory and make space for other processes, the suspended process is moved to the secondary storage. <br>
**5.[Dispatcher Latency](https://shrubbery.net/solaris9ab/SUNWdev/NETPROTO/p43.html)**<br>
Amount of time a system to respond before executing it<br>
**6.[Two State Model](https://t4tutorials.com/two-state-process-model-in-operating-systems/)**<br>
In short two state model, as it names suggests, is consist of 2 states. Not running state (process waiting for execution) and running state (process in progress/execution.)<br>
**7.[FCFS Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)**<br>
FCFS Scheduling(First Come First Serve) is where a process queued first/comes first is executed first. Similar to Stack in data structures in execution order.<br>
**8.[SJF Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling.html)**<br>
SJF Scheduling(Shortest Job First) is where a process with smallest execution time is chosen first.<br>
**9.NUMA[(Simple Version)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-uniform-memory-access-uma-and-non-uniform-memory-access-numa/)[(More Detailed)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/NUMA-non-uniform-memory-access)**<br>
NUMA(Non-uniform Memory Access) is a computer memory design where multiple processors working under a single operating system access each other's memory over a common bus or "interconnect" path.<br>
**10.[OVA File](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/MSBTech/Installing+OVA+files+using+VirtualBox)**<br>
OVA File in short is like a backup or express installation for a Virtual Machine (VM). Let's just say that it is pretty similar like how you install an app in android devices using apk file.
